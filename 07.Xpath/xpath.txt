Stsrt with
Chained xpath declaratiom
Or
And

Locator an element
Absolute XPath
•	It is a direct way to locate an element.
•	It is very brittle.
•	Starts with single slash “/” that means starting to search from the root.
Relative XPath
•	Starts from the middle of the HTML DOM.
•	Starts with a double slash “//” that means it can start to search anywhere in the DOM structure.
•	Shorter than Absolute XPath.
•	Less fragile.
1.id:



Contains:
Syntax: //tag[contains(@attribute, ‘value‘)]
Example: //input[contains(@id, ‘er-messa’)]
START-WITH
Syntax: //tag[starts-with(@attribute, ‘value‘)]
Example: //input[starts-with(@id, ‘user’)]



Following:
/coming down
/..going up
Exp: 
		
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[text()='Date of birth']//following::div/table/tbody/tr/td/select/option[text()='January']")).click();
Following-Sibling:Forword Direction
Preceeding-Sibling:Backword direction

You have identify the first child and don’t have to choose the 2nd and 4th child  or there is nothing unique
Then we can use child.
Following and Preceeding sibling only work when the child is come under same parents.

CHILD: https://www.actitime.com/
//div[@class='header__container']/child::nav/child::ul/child::li[1]

Following-Sibling:
Forword Direction with same parent
Examp: //a[text()='Features']//parent::*/following-sibling::li[2]

Preceeding-sibling
Backword direction with same parent
//a[text()='Clients']//parent::*/preceding-sibling::li[2]

NOTE:1:
If for same xpath we are getting two elements then use below two method 
1.store in a list and access by element 
2.search for parent/grand parent  they must be



Example:1:
Jobs in https://www.naukri.com/mnjuser/homepage
Solution 1: (//div[text()='Jobs'])[1]
Solution 2: //a/div[text()='Jobs']
Note 2:
How to navigate from Requiter to Jobs
//a/div[text()='Recruiters']/../../../li/a/span/following-sibling::div[text()='Jobs']
Note 3:
How to navigate Service to insights
//div[text()='Services']/../../preceding-sibling::li/a/div[text()='Insights']
